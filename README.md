Engineering leader with 10+ years of experience in the tech industry. My career started in software development and later gradually shifted into tech management. I have extensive hands-on experience in engineering and project/people management, gained through intensive work in related positions. Since then I’ve also learned a few things in analytics, data science and product management. 

My professional interests are related to the above competencies, both business and engineering oriented. I enjoy finding the right approach to problems, designing optimal implementations, and collaborating with a team to build the final solution. 

Currently I’m responsible for search, ads, recommendations and ML infra at [Ozon](https://www.ozon.ru/), a leading ecommerce marketplace in Russia & CIS.
