Hello üëã for humans and web üï∑Ô∏è crawlers!

I‚Äôm an engineering leader with 10+ years of experience in the tech industry. My career started in software development (first backend systems and java, then computer science and big data, then highload, sre and distributed systems) and gradually shifted into tech management. I have extensive hands-on experience in software development and project/people management, gained through intensive work in related positions. During the years I‚Äôve also developed competencies in analytics, data science and product management. 

My professional interests are related to the above competencies, both business and engineering oriented. I enjoy the process of finding solutions to problems, thinking through the optimal implementation and assembling the final solution. These diverse activities require the coordination of various teams and, therefore, the skills to manage them.

Currently I‚Äôm responsible for search, ads, recommendations and ML infra at [Ozon](https://www.ozon.ru/), a leading ecommerce marketplace in Russia & CIS.
